# well-logs-plot
This is my python function that plots geological well logs in a slightly more physically appealing way. Only the first version! I will continue to add more features.

In this version, I focused on plotting my caliper in a way that makes it easy to identify hole issues. I have normalized the caliper log, but this is an optional step.
